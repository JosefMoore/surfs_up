### Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project was to expand on our previous analysis. Specifically, we were to analyze the temperature date during the months of June and December over the last few years to see if an ice cream business would be sustainable year-round. 

### Results
After some quick coding, I was able to procure summary statistics for both months over the last few years. 

* The average temperature in June was around 75 degrees and the average in December was 71 degrees; pretty close!

* The high temperature in June was 85 degrees and the high in December was 83 degrees. This shows the temperature remains consistent throughout the year, historically!

* The lowest it's been in December was 56 degrees. This isn't super cold, and even if the ice cream isn't sold, you can still surf!

### Conclusion
From the look of things, Oahu seems to be a great spot to set up the ice cream spot. Average temperatures seem to be mid to low 70s, perfect for ice cream and surfing. 

* One query we could add would be a summary statistic per year to see if temperatures have been trending in a certain way over the years. 

* We could also add a query to filter by only the most active weather stations to make sure we're getting more accurate results.
